This project was create in Summer of 2019, which serves to act as a primitive UI based CMD prompt that shows an amortized loan payment schedule. The program
will guide you through what to input (interest rate, sum, months to finish, etc.)

I fixed the whitespacing in the majority of this code to make it legible and able to skim through, but it ultimately remains unchanged from when it was first finished.I
chose to do this mainly to show improvement in programming and problem solving skills and methods in both syntax and practicality over the years.
